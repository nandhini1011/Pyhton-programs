2.Electricity Bill Calculation

The consolidated power consumption for a commercial complex is sent in the following
format by EB department for a month. The complex has 5 shops each having a separate
meter box and the electricity tariff total for a month has to be calculated for each shop
separately based on the number of units consumed.
NOTE: The same shop may have more than one entry in a single line. Sometimes if a
shop does not
consume energy it will not be part of the list. On power shutdown days the entry will be
nothing just the date
Find the total power consumed if each shop is charged in the following slabs
First 999 units: 0.40/unit
1000-2000 units: 0.33/unit
2001-5000 units: 0.30/unit
5000+units: 0.20/unit
